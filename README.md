# IoT-Based-Smart-Fish-Pond-Management-System
This is a system that detects changes in water quality parameters (water ph, water level, water salinity and water temperature) in the pond and sends the real time data to the web server via a wireless network.
In the video link text file there is a google drive link where you can view the demonstration video for the project.
