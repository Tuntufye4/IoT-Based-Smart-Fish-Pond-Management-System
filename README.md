# SMART FISH POND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This is a system that detects changes in Pond water quality parameters (water ph, water level, water salinity and water temperature) and sends the real time data to the web server (Continous data logging) via a wireless network.
In the video link text file there is a google drive link where you can view the demonstration video for the project.
I developed this system as my final project for my Bachelors degree at the University of Livingstonia. At first, I implemented it using a wired network and an API based on COM ports called PLX-DAQ. Recently, I have upgraded it, and it sends data to web server panel via a wireless network using ESP8266 wifi module.
The data can be used in predicting fish yield using machine learning.
The electronics part has an arduino microcontroller, ESP8266 wifi module, PH sensor, waterproof temperature sensor and ultrasonic sensor.
